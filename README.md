# searchIt
Small project that opens multiple google search tabs at once. Created to help my partner quickly search multiple addresses from an excel sheet.

Paste in each search on a new line and hit submit to open up all the links.
On the first try it may only open one link and prompt you to disable popups for the site.
WARNING: maybe don't open so many links at once? Idk how your computer will handle it. I am not responsible if it bluescreens SO use at own risk~ ðŸ˜˜
